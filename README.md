# WildHacks

The main inspiration behind this project is to reduce smuggling of animals by using a motion detector. We have given three different modules in our webpage, i.e, a Sensor that will detect animal movement by scanning any luggage, a Play Station with a game named Clumsy Bird and an Explore module to which shows details of different animals with a download button to download android app of the same module.
